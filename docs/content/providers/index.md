# Providers

The provider system allows for flexible configuration of backends. Each provider provides a different option for how certain functionality should be implemented. As opposed to a generic plugin system, this allows for more defined customizations. 

Like the [main configuration system](../configuration.md), configuration in environment variables are given precedence over configuration in files.
